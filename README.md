Dark Rabbit is my game for the 31st Ludum Dare. It was developped under a 48 hours constraint, including code, art, audio, and all. So don't take the code as an example of what to do to make a game, it's full of shortcuts, some global variables and other bad things just for the sake of finishing the game within the 48h.

Dark Rabbit is a game in which you are a evil genious, for a rabbit. You want to take your revenge on the kid that tortured you while a little cute mini rabbit. To do that, you decide to kill all kids you'll encounter. Of course kids tend to catch you too, when they're smart enough.
